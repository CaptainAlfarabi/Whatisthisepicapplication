Tried putting and using all my python progress together so far.

11/4/2023 - I'm going to stop updating this, I made a ton of prgress by working on this and it was really fun but I think<br>it is getting a bit messy for me. Overall I think this<br>went really nicely and I don't recall ever coming close to 200 lines of code.
